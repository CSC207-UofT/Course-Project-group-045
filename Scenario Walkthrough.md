Scenario Walkthrough

Two players and two enemies are initialized on a 2 by 2 map. The position and health of
all characters should be printed in the terminal. The terminal would then announce
the player turn and would prompt the user to enter a character name, if the user enters an
invalid character name they would be asked to re-enter a name. If the character name is
valid they would prompted to enter the name of an enemy character and if the enemy character
name input is invalid they would be prompted to re-enter a valid input. If it is valid
It will print the amount of damage done to the terminal as well as the enemy's new health total.
This will repeat until all player characters have used their action, at which point the enemy turn will
start and all player character actions are refreshed. Characters are removed from the map once their health is 0,
and the game ends when all enemies are cleared off the map.
