Phase 2 Specification

The project is a grid based turn based strategy game based on the popular franchise Fire Emblem.

A main feature added in Phase 2 was menu screens, which appear at game startup and where you can select different characters to play with and maps to play on.
This feature allows foreasy extention in the case we want to add additional characters or maps. 

The player selects a team of characters with varied stats and completes a map by eliminating all enemies. 
The game is controlled through a mouse, which is used to issue commands to player characters or to view stats.
A health stat keeps track of character health,and when a character's health is depleted,they are removed from the map.

Commands include:
Movement, where characters move across tiles based on a speed stat. Phase 2 work on this feature included optimization, pathfinding around obstacles, 
and elimination of errors. 
Attacking, Characters can also attack enemies and deal damage based on their attack stat.  Phase 2 work on this feature included the ability to attack
an enemy character beyond close range by moving in addition to attacking, which counts as only a single aciton. Also the addition of ranged characters and healers.
Item usage, a feature implemented entirely in phase 2, where a character selects and uses an item from a popup menu. Items currently implemented include stat modifiers. 

Additional features from phase 2 include:
Transitions and graphics that were added to indicate when character actions are used and when turns are over.
Graphics that display stats and show when a character is selected.
Enemy AI characters actions, which are controlled by basic logic.  
Various UI additions.
