The project can be accessed by running the main method of the Game class

Phase 2 Specification

The project is a grid based turn based strategy game based on the popular franchise Fire Emblem.

A main feature added in Phase 2 was menu screens, which appear at game startup and where you can select different characters to play with and maps to play on.
This feature allows foreasy extention in the case we want to add additional characters or maps. 

The player selects a team of characters with varied stats and completes a map by eliminating all enemies. 
The game is controlled through a mouse, which is used to issue commands to player characters or to view stats.
A health stat keeps track of character health,and when a character's health is depleted,they are removed from the map.

Commands include:
Movement, where characters move across tiles based on a speed stat. Phase 2 work on this feature included optimization, pathfinding around obstacles, 
and elimination of errors. 
Attacking, Characters can also attack enemies and deal damage based on their attack stat.  Phase 2 work on this feature included the ability to attack
an enemy character beyond close range by moving in addition to attacking, which counts as only a single aciton. Also the addition of ranged characters and healers.
Item usage, a feature implemented entirely in phase 2, where a character selects and uses an item from a popup menu. Items currently implemented include stat modifiers. 

Additional features from phase 2 include:
Transitions and graphics that were added to indicate when character actions are used and when turns are over.
Graphics that display stats and show when a character is selected.
Enemy AI characters actions, which are controlled by basic logic.  
Various UI additions.

Likely areas for future extension and expansion:
Additional characters
Additional maps
Additional items
Additional graphics
Weapon system for increased strategy

Design Decisions:

Clean Architechture:
Clean Architecture: We have segregated our classes into packages based on their roles in the clean architecture hierarchy.
Characters, items and the map count as entities. 
The Action class is our use case.
The Game class is a gateway, and the UI class is self-explanatory in its purpose.

SOLID Design Principles:
Single Responsibility principle - All of our classes have a single responsibility. Open/closed principle- All of our entities can be extended and we can modify details to subclasses without changing the functionality of the entity.
Liskov Substitution method - Our item interface, where you may make an item that is a consumable can be replaced by the parent type of Item, or Hppot the type can be substituted as a consumable.
Interface Segregation Principle - Our item interface is relatively small, with just a view key functionalities. 
Dependency Inversion Principle - Changing individual pieces of our code, wouldn't require us to change other pieces of our code, such as characters and item, changes to either of them are independent.

Design Patterns:
When it comes to implementation of the interactions between items and characters, I would say we used the Dependency Injection pattern, where we avoid hard dependency
between the two classes and instead pass an object of character to a certain item method which prevents hard dependency. In a way we also implemented the Strategy
design pattern, where we use an Item interface, where multiple different items with different statistical modifiers implement Item, so when implementing interactions like characters,
the action class, or the game class, it relies upon the Item interface, which means it is only dependent on the particular functions that all items have.

Phase 2 Progress Report:

Phase 2 Accessability:
Equitable use: the project provides an similar experience for all users without segregating or stimatizing
Flexability in use: The game is controlled using mouse, which allows for both right and left handed use. Precise clicking is unncesssary due to the size of the grid and 
  character models. Game adapts completely to user's pace as it is turn based with no timer. 
Simple and Intuative use: Game controls are easy to learn and straightfoward. Minimal literacy and language is needed. Relevant actions have visual feedback(moving models, attack animations).
Perceptible information: Game uses multiple systems to highlight important information including attack and movement range indicators, character stat screens, icons.
Tolerance for error: Character models are large and easy to click. Action preview shown for movement and attacks, allowing for cancelation if the player changes their mind.
  eliminated errors/exceptions from unexpected actions in the graphical interface.
Low physical effort: Game only requires mouse controls, allows for healthy body position and ease of use.
Size and space for approach and use: Game screen is compact with large graphics, allowing for clear visuals even when standing or from a distance. Mouse controls
  neatly in a small area, no need for a giant mousepad or desk
